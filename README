Django based server for the oframe idea. OFrame was an idea to have a picture frame like device in peoples houses that displayed images from social media. This was a POC that pulled in images from your facebook and display it on a client.

Example would be that you buy your grandmother the OFrame and configure it to display pictures from her family. It would sit on her table and just slideshow through pictures. It would be touchscreen to allow her to go forward or back on pictures she liked. Other features could be that she likes a picture and it will show more often, dislike a picture and it won't show etc. It would also be a platform for other apps to run on.

It could potentially even show ads and be funded in that way.
